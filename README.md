Plan.

Keep react skills sharp.

Fetch goldbar data from rails backend.

Display data in cards in a grid, make sure that components are separated.

Build a filter search bar,

Build a Show or hide card button,

Build a 'add card to storage' button,

Build a Vault page where we can see cards in storage,

......................................................

Then redesign backend to allow for CRUD,

......................................................

Incorporate CRUD functionality into the front end.

First create a build card page,

Then create an edit card page,

Then have a delete card page.

......................................................
