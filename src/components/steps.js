//This is part of the life cycle method, at the start of the lifecycle the app fetches
//initial data from the backend, only once the components have rendered.
//Next Step is to build a Card component that will render multiple 'goldbars' on the page

//This needs to filter the cards displayed.

//Next step, create a storage for cards I want to put in my vault.

//then create a button to store cards
//install redux
